Bugfix: Fix behavior for foobar (in present tense)

We've fixed the behavior for foobar, a long-standing annoyance for users. The
text should be wrapped at 80 characters length.

The text in the paragraphs is written in past tense. The last section is a list
of issue URLs, PR URLs and other URLs. The first issue ID (or the first PR ID,
in case there aren't any issue links) is used as the primary ID.
