As this project is built with Go you need to install Go first. The installation of Go is out of the scope of this document, please follow the [official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install). After the installation of Go you need to get the sources:

{{< highlight txt >}}
git clone https://github.com/promhippie/hetzner_exporter.git
cd hetzner_exporter/
{{< / highlight >}}

All required tool besides Go itself are bundled by Go modules, all you need is part of the `Makfile`:

{{< highlight txt >}}
make generate build
{{< / highlight >}}

Finally you should have the binary within the `bin/` folder now, give it a try with `./bin/hetzner_exporter -h` to see all available options.
